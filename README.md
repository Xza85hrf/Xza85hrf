# Hey, I'm Ravi

I'm the guy who got tired of doing the same IT tasks over and over, so I started building tools to do them for me.

What started as "let me automate this one thing" turned into a bunch of projects - from system monitors to AI-powered transcription tools to a robot spider (yes, really).

## What I Do

I work in IT support, but I code on the side. A lot. Mostly Python, some web stuff, and lately I've been diving deep into AI/ML because it's genuinely useful - not just hype.

My sweet spot is taking annoying, repetitive problems and turning them into automated solutions.

## Some Things I've Built

**For IT/Sysadmin work:**
- [SmartUPS](https://github.com/Xza85hrf/SmartUPS) - monitors my UPS on a Raspberry Pi, alerts me before things go wrong
- [gpu-monitor](https://github.com/Xza85hrf/gpu-monitor) - quick visual check on GPU/memory usage
- [Ollama_monitor](https://github.com/Xza85hrf/Ollama_monitor) - tests if my local AI server is actually responding
- [ML-Framework_Checker](https://github.com/Xza85hrf/ML-Framework_Checker) - checks if PyTorch/TensorFlow/CUDA are set up right (saved me hours of debugging)
- [Excel-Tools](https://github.com/Xza85hrf/Excel-Tools) - file verification, data generation, and comparison utilities

**Audio/Video processing:**
- [VoiceSmith-Complete](https://github.com/Xza85hrf/VoiceSmith-Complete) - transcription, translation, subtitles - all in one
- [Whisper-Subtitle-Generator](https://github.com/Xza85hrf/Whisper-Subtitle-Generator) - throws audio at Whisper, gets subtitles back
- [Subtitle_Translator](https://github.com/Xza85hrf/Subtitle_Translator) - batch translate .srt files

**AI experiments that actually work:**
- [flux_pipeline](https://github.com/Xza85hrf/flux_pipeline) - image generation with FLUX.1
- [ai-background-removal](https://github.com/Xza85hrf/ai-background-removal) - tried multiple models, compared results
- [deep-cline](https://github.com/Xza85hrf/deep-cline) - AI coding assistant in VS Code
- [multi-agent-platform](https://github.com/Xza85hrf/multi-agent-platform) - multi-agent AI orchestration framework

**Hardware projects (the fun stuff):**
- [Arachne_Picrawler](https://github.com/Xza85hrf/Arachne_Picrawler) - robot spider that talks to GPT-4/Claude/Ollama
- [dARM-ai](https://github.com/Xza85hrf/dARM-ai) - 6-axis robotic arm, designed and 3D printed the whole thing

## Tech I Use

Python mostly. Django/FastAPI for web stuff. React when I need a frontend. PyTorch for ML. Docker to keep things sane. Raspberry Pi for hardware projects.

## Looking For

IT Support Specialist roles where I can actually use my dev skills - not just reset passwords all day.

Open to remote work.
